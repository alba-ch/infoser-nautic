# Simple Medusa Backend Deployment

## Deploy to Render (Easiest Method)

1. Sign up at [Render.com](https://render.com) (free, no credit card required)

2. Deploy directly from GitHub:
   - Click "New" â†’ "Blueprint"
   - Connect your GitHub repository

That's it! Your backend will be deployed with a free PostgreSQL database.

## Alternative: Deploy to Railway

   - Start command: `npm start`

4. Add a PostgreSQL database from the Railway dashboard

5. Link the database by setting the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
